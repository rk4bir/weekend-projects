# Pandemic Live (covid19)
>This is my first flutter project. "Pandemic Live" is a free application, aimed to provide "COVID19" pandemic update. It shows global and country wise update along with analytical chart/graph and data table in real time. This app fetch data from [mathdroid's covid19-api](https://github.com/mathdroid/covid-19-api) and [covid19api.com](https://covid19api.com/). They both serve JSON data from John Hopkins University CSSE.

**NB: If you see any inconsistency in data, assume that the JHU data is under maintainance.**
